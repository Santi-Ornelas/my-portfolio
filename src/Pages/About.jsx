    I studied finance. I worked in strategy consulting. I left it all to build â€” because I realized Iâ€™d rather create tools that empower people than polish slides no one will remember.
    </p>
    <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
    Right now, Iâ€™m learning full-stack, experimenting with AI, and pushing myself to design a braver life â€” in public, with transparency, grit, and purpose.
