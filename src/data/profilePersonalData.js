  description: `I walked away from a fast-track career in strategy consulting to chase something deeper — the urge to build.

For years, I believed my path was clear: climb the corporate ladder, become a leading voice in Latin America's financial sector, and drive impact through deals and boardroom strategy. That was the “dream.”

But something inside kept pulling me elsewhere.

Beneath the accolades and acceleration, I heard a quieter voice — one that craved creation over convention. I realized I wasn’t meant to advise from the sidelines. I was meant to build, to solve real problems, and to lead from the front lines of innovation.

So I made the leap.

Today, I’m forging a new path in full-stack development, blending business acuity with technical execution. I’m not here to dip my toes in. I’m here to earn my place — through grit, purpose, and relentless discipline.`,
